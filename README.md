# Weekly Sales Analysis
This Python project demonstrates basic sales analysis using NumPy and Pandas libraries.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using the following command:
   pip install numpy pandas
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the Python file (main.py).
5. Run the program using a Python interpreter
6. The program will execute and display the items sold, weekly sales, item prices, and total sales.

## Example Output:
